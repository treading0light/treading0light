# Come on in!

## Who is this guy?
I am a developer eager to be a part of a great technological revolution, one that will provide unprecedented methods of storytelling and life-living.

## Missions
- To build things that people WANT to use.
- To chase the part of human nature that creates solutions.
- To traverse a lifelong path of learning.
- To put order to chaos, and to take from chaos that which will improve order.

## What else?
Currently, I am building a SaaS project for a client using Laravel, Livewire, Volt, and will soon provide that software to businesses everywhere. 
I aim to find a balance between personal projects and my main grind.
